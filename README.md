# BigInt
C++ library for larger than natively supported unsigned integer operations 

Supports +, -, *, and / operations.

Made because GNU MP library doesnt compile on windows and I just needed something which would allow for a couple hundred digits.

BigInt.h is the working file.

To see if working properly call run_tests in test.h and check output log
