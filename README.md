## Project aim

C++ library for larger than natively supported unsigned integer operations. Meant to be used in any project and operating system easily. Not a replacement for the GNU MP library.

## Usage

BigInt.h is latest file which works. Copy and paste into wherever and compile with the project.
**Note**: Requires c++17 or higher.

## Algorithms

Be warned all algorithms were created from scratch, they are not the most efficient out there.
